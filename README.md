# Election-Simulator
Much of this assignment was inspired by Chapter 2 of Programming for Lovers by Philip Compeau.
For this coding assignment I was asked to run a simplified version of the election simulations that professional analysts run.
The simulated election takes place across several districts, each made up of a differing number of voters. Additionally, we will run multiple simulations to compute a more accurate
result. The predicted winner is the party with the highest average vote percentage across all the simulations we run.
To make things a bit more simple, these assumptions were made.
There are only two parties running in the election, and all votes cast are for one of those two parties. (There are no write-in candidates and no blank ballots.)
Each party has a consistent polling average in all districts. (This is rarely true in the real world.)
The results in each district are independent of each other, meaning the results in one district are not in any way related to the results in any other district. (This is also rarely true.) 
All votes are random.
